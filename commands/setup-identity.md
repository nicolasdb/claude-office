description: "First-time setup — configure your identity, fill out your profile, and learn how the plugin works. Usage: /setup-identity <your-name> <vault-path>"
argument-hint: "<your-name> <vault-path>"
---

This is the onboarding command. It sets up identity, fills out the user's profile, and explains the plugin.

**Example:** `/setup-identity alex C:/Users/alex/Documents/ingram-vault`

**Key principle:** Write to profile.md progressively — after each section is collected, write it immediately. Don't batch everything at the end. This way if the conversation is interrupted, partial progress is saved.

## Step 1: Identity

If arguments are provided, parse as `<name>` and `<vault-path>`. Otherwise ask:
- "What's your name?" (must match their folder name in `/team/<name>/`, and the identity name in `identity.json`, case sensitive)
- "Where is your obsidian vault?" (absolute path, e.g., `C:/Users/alex/Documents/ingram-vault`)

**The vault is a separate GitHub repository** (not part of this plugin). It's an Obsidian vault where the team keeps docs, project statuses, and coordination files. It should already contain `CLAUDE.md`, a `/team/` folder, and a `/team/_new_user/` template. If you don't have the vault yet, direct the user to set it up with the init command first.

Create `~/.claude-office/` and `~/.claude-office/logs/` if they don't exist.

Write `~/.claude-office/identity.json` if it doesn't already exist:
```json
{
  "name": "<name>",
  "vault": "<vault-path>"
}
```

Verify the vault path exists and contains `CLAUDE.md`. Verify `/team/<name>/` exists. If not, offer to create it from `/team/_new_user/` — copy the folder, replace all `<PUT YOUR NAME HERE>` placeholders with their name.

Make sure the hooks are allowed with chmod if on mac/linux.

## Step 2: Fill Out Profile (Progressive)

First inform the user they can give their github, linkedin or any other existing profile with information on them to populate the vault as much as possible automatically, or do it manually. If they give it, read as much as you can and also extract a picture of them to add to the vault.
Also tell them to drop their https://www.manualof.me/ if they have one, to add to their profile, and highly suggest to make one. This is for close team cooperation, the github vault stays private, but this information is crucial for working together. Do not ask any following question for which you already have the answer from these sources.

Read `/team/<name>/profile.md`. Walk the user through each section below. **After each section, write the answers into profile.md immediately** before moving to the next section.

**Auto-detect what you can** — don't ask questions you can answer from the environment:
- OS: `uname -s` / `$OS` / `$OSTYPE`
- Shell: `$SHELL` or `$0`
- Node version, Python version if available
- MCP servers: read `~/.claude/settings.json` if accessible

### 2a. Role & About
Ask:
- What's your role? (e.g., Security Engineer, Full-Stack Developer, DevOps)
- Fun fact — something about themselves (hobby, hot take, superpower)

→ **Write to profile.md** (Role, Joined date, Fun fact)

### 2b. Environment
Auto-detect OS, shell, and MCP servers. Ask about:
- Device (laptop model, desktop)
- IDEs and editors (VS Code, JetBrains, Cursor, Neovim, etc.)
- AI coding tools (Claude Code, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
- Browser and extensions
- Package managers

→ **Write to profile.md** (full Environment section)

### 2c. Security
Read the security section template from the user's `profile.md` (copied from `_new_user/`). The template defines what fields need filling — don't hardcode questions here, just walk through whatever the template asks for.

Mention: "If you'd rather fill out the security section manually later, just say 'skip' and you can edit `team/<name>/profile.md` directly anytime."

If they choose to fill it now, walk through each field in the template and write answers as you go.

→ **Write to profile.md** (Security section — or mark as skipped)

### 2d. Contact & Project
- How to reach them (Slack, email)
- Which project are they primarily working on? (list available projects from `/projects/`)

→ **Write to profile.md** (Contact + note their main project)

## Step 3: Explain the Plugin

After setup is complete, give the user a brief orientation:

> **You're all set!** Here's how the Ingram Office plugin works:
>
> **Automatic (you don't need to do anything):**
> - When you start a session, the plugin pulls the latest vault changes and shows you a quick summary
> - When your session ends, it logs what docs you changed to `team/<name>/activity/activity.md` (and per-project activity files) and pushes everything
>
> **Commands you can run:**
> - `/check-in` — Start of day briefing. Shows what you were last working on, your priorities across projects, who you need to coordinate with, and your personal todos
> - `/aggregate` — Rebuilds project status views with per-person notes. Runs daily on a schedule, but you can trigger it manually
> - `/retro` — Generates a weekly retrospective from git history
>
> **How coordination works:**
> `/aggregate` analyzes git history and writes notes into each project's status.md — things like what you should focus on next and who you need to sync with. When you run `/check-in`, it reads those notes so you get a personalized briefing.
>
> **Your files:**
> - `team/<name>/profile.md` — your bio (what we just filled out)
> - `team/<name>/tasks.md` — your personal todo list (only you manage this)
> - `team/<name>/activity/activity.md` — automatic log of your doc changes (plugin writes this)
>
> **Task tracking happens in GitHub** — the vault is for documentation and coordination.
>
> Restart your session for the hooks to activate, then try `/check-in`.

## Step 4: Commit

Stage and commit the user's new/updated folder:
```bash
git add team/<name>/
git commit -m "[<name>] onboarding — profile setup"
git push
```
